# PROTECTIVE PENGUIN #3: Egg Hunt

## Challenge Description

> After moving laterally, PROTECTIVE PENGUIN compromised a number of additional systems and gained persistence. We have identified another host in the DMZ that we believe was backdoored by the adversary and is used to regain access.
> 
> Please download a virtual machine image of that host and identify the backdoor. Validate your findings in our test environment on egghunt.challenges.adversary.zone.

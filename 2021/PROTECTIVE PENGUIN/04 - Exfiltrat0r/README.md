# PROTECTIVE PENGUIN #4: Exfiltrat0r

## Challenge Description

> Additional analysis of the victim network allowed us to recover some PROTECTIVE PENGUIN tooling that appears to provide remote shell and data exfiltration capabilities. While we were able to capture some network traffic of these tools in action, all communications are encrypted. We have wrapped all relevant information into a TAR archive.
> 
> Are you able to identify any weaknesses that would allow us to recover the encryption key and figure out what data was exfiltrated?

# CATAPULT SPIDER #4: Many Neurotoxin

## Challenge Description

> Our investigation revealed that CATAPULT SPIDER uses artificial intelligence to classify images. We initially believed that they only encrypt cat pictures - but we now learned that they encrypt all images except Doge photographs. We recovered their classifier and model and believe it should be possible to subvert their classification method to protect images against encryption.
> 
> We are providing a TAR file that contains their classification logic, model and three pictures that must be protected at all cost. We also stood up a service that integrates CATAPULT SPIDER's classification logic at

> If you're confident that you can protect the images by getting CATAPULT SPIDER to misclassify them, please submit them to our service to receive your reward.
